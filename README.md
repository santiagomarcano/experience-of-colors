# Experience of colors

This is just a little webpage that aims to take every color from your photos and render them sequentially on a canvas element.

There is a lot of space for improvements here since I just did this laying on the couch while eating grapes. BUT, it works.

VanillaJS ended up being messy.. Sorry..

I'll try to fix it on the future to come.
