# Experience of colors

This is just a little webpage that aims to take some colors from your photos and render them as your selected option on a canvas element.

It will output a 1080x1080 image of the result.

At this commit, the color filter is set to let render colors with saturation over 80 and light over 10.

Arcs are really demanding objects so if you try to render a circle, it will filter an eight of the total amount of colors.

There is a lot of space for improvements here since I just did this laying on the couch while eating grapes. BUT, it works.

Migration to Svelte :D
